Hard deadline:  Due Date December 22nd,  end-of-day.
Fully completing this programming extra credit assignment is worth 5 points towards the final course grade.
Submit your programming assignment by pushing your work to your private cs260 GitHub repo that you created at the start of the semester.
This is an alternative to the ZyBooks extra credit. Only one extra credit is applied towards the final course grade.

Task:
Implement Quine-McCluskey as seen here: https://learn.zybooks.com/zybook/CUNYCS260FilinFall2023
Note: Your implementation can be Object Oriented or Procedural.



Requirements for your implementation of Quine-McCluskey:
1) Input: string containing a sum-of-minterms function.
   For example: "f(a,b) = a'b' + a'b + ab'"

2) Must use the Implicant class that you have created.
   Goal is to generate the Primary Implicants:
	Consider members of the onset pairwise, calling simplify() method combining new terms in a new iterable
  	Repeating with new terms until no more combinations can be made. 
	Each term that wasn't combined with another (minterms or new terms) is a prime implicant (PI). 

   i)  Make use of the hamming weight
   ii) You can add additional methods to the Implicant class, if needed.

3) Output: print the table such that
	columns = minterms from onset expressed as integers
	   rows = Prime Implicants that you found 
	    x is printed if Pi covers a minterm
      
   For example:
  
		      0     1     2

	a' (0, 1)     x     x

	b' (0, 2)     x           x

4) Indicate which Prime Implicants are Essential

5) Make sure to test your implementation.
